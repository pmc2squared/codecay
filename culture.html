    <strong>Star of My Life</strong> <br>

    <strong>National Day in June</strong><br>
    The country celebrates its birthday and its beauty. CodeCadians dress up in flowers or seashells in appreciation of the abundance of the island. In an island where nothing is wasted, CodeCadians spend the entire year collecting seashells from the beach or flowers from their gardens to create masterpieces to wear on this special day. 
    </p>

    <p>
    <strong>Singles Day in March </strong><br>
    Code Cay has its own holiday where being single is celebrated. On this day, individuals can recognize their single friends, family members, colleagues and fellow citizens by giving gifts and flowers. There are multiple celebrations throughout the island where fireworks cap off the evening, and where singles can meet and mingle with other singles. Sparklers are lit during these celebrations to symbolize the spark within each individual, although in more modern times, blessings are given (usually by anxious parents) over the sparklers to help singles find their special someone. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
     <strong>Rainbow Rave in October </strong><br>   
     CodeCadians throw rainbow-hued powder at their neighbors during this festival, leaving everyone coated in color by the end of the day. The rainbow symbolizes the multiculturalism of Code Cay as well as the defeat of evil. The mermaids and unicorns who were the first inhabitants of Code Cay lived in peace and prosperity until the evil Nim took power by force. The mermaids and unicorns managed to overthrow him after many long and costly battles, and the unicorn leader Bright sent forth a rainbow to commemorate their victory and to remember all the lives that had been lost.
