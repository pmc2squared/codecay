    <div class="foodintro">
        <p>CodeCay has a rich variety of foods and drinks, adopted and adapted since unicorns were first discovered and developed as part of a multi-cultural society. What was once new and foreign has been transformed with new ingredients and styles into distinctly CodeCadian food.</p> 
        <p>In the early pre-unicorn days, there was much ingenuity, originality and innovation in cooking. Menus included seafood, fish and vegetables, as well as native fruits and nuts. Native fruits, such as pomegranate, mango, or hibiscus, wild raspberries and native currants, were harvested for profit as well as for domestic use.</p>
        <p>Stores of rum and beer, as well as the makings for them, grapevine cuttings for wine, coffee plants and beans, and ginger are very popular alcoholic beverages. Ginger beer, cordial and lemonade factories sprang up as the unicorn colonies developed. </p>
        <p>At the time of Unicornification in 1901, a change in eating and cooking styles reflected new healthy eating values. Outdoor picnics were enthusiastically adopted, establishing the tradition of Rose by the ocean. There were new staple foods for main meals: Shrimp Du Jour, Sushi Bowls and Mango-Pomegranate Salad.</p>
        <p>From the 1880s, grand ornate coffee palaces offered coffee drinking and dining as alternatives to the alcohol fuelled atmosphere of the pubs. Coffee lounges became part of the modern cay culture of the 1920s and 30s and expanded with the influx of American servicemen and European migrants in the 1940s.</p>
        <p>Innovations based on new ingredients created new recipes. New desserts, cakes and biscuits, such as Unilava, Shellingtons and ginger biscuits went down well with a cup of tea, a near universal drink. Phrases like a Shelly of Tea', and later additions such as Unzac biscuits and unimite were added to the vocabulary. Unimite spread was invented in 1923 by CodeCay scientist Dr. Starr Pat Lorenta as a way to exploit the yeast left over from beer production.</p>
        <p>Today, many contemporary CodeCay chefs display these qualities of innovation and bold experimentation in their expression of originality, and are recognised worldwide for their skill and imagination.</p>

         <h2><center>Black-Pearl Ship-Wreck Sushi Bowl</center></h2>
         <div class="food3_image"><img src="images/food/sushi.jpg"/></div>
         <div class="food3_text"><p>Literally meaning “jammed packed food,” a sushi-bowl is something you’ve probably been doing your whole life, ever since you ate oatmeal cereal for breakfast before school in the morning. Well, kind of — CodeCadians do it a bit differently.</p>
         <p>Beyond breakfast before school, Sushi Bowls something pretty much every CodeCadian eats before they go riding with the unicorns & snow leopards, swimming with the mermaids, and dancing on the water . It’s super simple: sliced salmon/tuna, homemade rice (has to be CodeCadian brown rice — more healthy) with mango, avocado, and other toppings, like vegetables. The sushi wraps are open-faced and there’s usually more than one, with a layer of special caviar. You’ll find the caviar at any local supermarket, and it’ll even be pre-packaged into the right sizes (with even larger bottles to brighten it all up).</p>
         <p><strong>Where to find it:</strong> True Sushi Bowls is homemade — the perfect excuse to get to know the locals on your trip!</p></div>

         <h2><center>Crackling Shrimp Du Jour w/ Brown Rice</center></h2>
         <div class="food4_image"><img src="images/food/shrimp.jpg"/></div>
         
         <div class="food4_text">
         <p>Crackling Shrimp Du Jour has special shrimp offerings throughout the year when the variety of shrimping is at it's peak season. You are able to join the Shrimpermen Crew out in the deep blue sea for a special excursion to land your best catch of the day.</p>
         
<h2><center>Brownie Shrimp</center></h2>
    <p>The peak season for catching brownie shrimp in CodeCay is June through August, although the warm winters in Southern CodeCay can bring good runs in January, February, March and April. This type of shrimp runs in color from brown to olive green, distinguishable by a pair of antenna that are longer than its body and a sort of sharp-tipped spear mounted above its head. During season, brownie shrimp can be found on the tip and top of the island, as well as in the Caves. Meat from this species of shrimp has a firmer texture and stronger flavor due to higher iodine content.</p>

<h2><center>Pinkie Shrimp </center></h2>
    <p>Pinkie shrimp reach their peak during two different times of the year. The first is from March to May. The shrimp become abundant again during the months October through December. Pinkie shrimp are found more often in the western CodeCay waters, especially in the caves, giving rise to the term "Code Caves Pinkies." This species of shrimp tends to grow the largest and has a tender, sweeter taste to its meat than the others. Pinkies are the most abundantly caught CodeCay shrimp. </p>

<h2><center>Rockie Shrimp</center></h2>
    <p>August through October are prime shrimping months for rock shrimp. Rock shrimp are caught in deeper water, primarily off the coast of the Tasman Sea of the island. While rock shrimp meat has the same sweet taste of its brownie, whitie, and pinkie cousins, its firmer texture makes a comparison to lobster meat somewhat appropriate. The name "rockie shrimp" comes from the tough shell exterior that is much harder than other shrimp species.</p>

<h2><center>Whitie Shrimp</center></h2>
    <p>On the northern Indian coast of CodeCay, whitie shrimp are at their peak for capture August through November. Despite the name, whities are actually more of a green-gray to blue-gray color. They turn the typical pink hue when cooked. Wild caught whitie shrimp have a sweet, firm texture to their meat that holds up well under a variety of recipes and cooking conditions, making it a favorite with chefs, locals and tourists alike. These shrimp spawn in the deeper ocean but are carried by tides and currents into coastal river mouths, bays and estuaries to mature just in time to land on a seafood lover's dinner plate.</p>

<p><strong>Where to find it:</strong> Crackling Shrimp Du Jour is common at hotel dinners, and you’ll see various shrimp dishes in just about any CodeCay restaurant.  CodeBay Café & Restaurant, serves excellent shrimp du jour with a ocean view.</p>
